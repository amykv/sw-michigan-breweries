# SWMichigan-Breweries
A website utilizing flexbox to show pictures of breweries in Berrien County, Michigan. Currently the user can click on one of the images to go the breweries main website. Images themselves hover.


Only one web page. Has an HTML file and CSS file. Imported one image locally, the others were found online.


This website is for beer fans and tourists of Berrien County. Also for me since I like the local breweries. Made this to work on my personal skills on HTML and CSS. Can be refactored for other areas/stores/restaurants/topics.


TO DO:


Add more breweries and possibly update current pictures.


Add hover text to each image.


Clean up header and footer.


Implement some Javascript, maybe SQL somehow. Make the website live.


Brainstorm more ideas for this website...
